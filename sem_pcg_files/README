Run ns.m in octave

It uses Jacobi (diagonal) PCG for the elliptic substeps.

It supports nontrivial null-space for the pressure and also
inhomogeneous Dirichlet conditions.

It is _slow_....   

   Possible Reasons:

   -- Need to profile the matlab/octave code
   -- Need multilevel preconditioner for pressure.
      (Why so many pressure iterations for such a small problem??)
